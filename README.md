# Recommendation Algorithm Prototype

This project is a prototype of a recommendation algorithm. It aims to search a local database for a product based on user input. If the product is found in the local database, it is displayed to the user. If the product is not found locally, the algorithm searches a larger information center (like Google) to identify the product and its details. Subsequently, the algorithm compares the product details with those in the local database to find similar items and make recommendations to the user based on this similarity.
